# _Coffee Sales Dashboard_ 

## Project Overview
This aim of the following project was to create a sales Dashboard for Coffee Sales from provided datasets, using only Excel for all needed processes. Ultimately, the interactive and dynamic dashboard enables the company to further understand the customer-to-product relationship, alongside the growth of the company over time. 

## Data Source
Datasets were sourced from a single Excel Workbook created by [Mo Chen](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx), a professional Data Analyst; however, the file has been included in this repository [Here](https://github.com/ShavonneReynolds/Coffee-Orders-Dashboard/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData%20(1).xlsx).
