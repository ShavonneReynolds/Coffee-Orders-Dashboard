# _Coffee Sales Dashboard_ 

## Project Overview
The following project aimed to create a Dashboard for Coffee Sales from provided datasets, using only Excel for all needed processes. Ultimately, the interactive and dynamic dashboard enables the company to understand the customer-to-product relationship further, alongside the growth of the company over time. Insights have been provided alongside suggestions for company growth dependent on the company's goal.

## Data Source
Datasets were sourced from a single Excel Workbook created by [Mo Chen](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx), a professional Data Analyst; however, the file has been included in this repository [Here](https://github.com/ShavonneReynolds/Coffee-Orders-Dashboard/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData%20(1).xlsx). 

- Data from January of 2019 to August of 2022
- Three Datasets
  - Orders, Customers, Products

## Tools 
- Excel
  - This project was an Excel-only project; therefore all processes were done using only Microsoft Excel.


## Process 

### Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Applied **XLOOKUP** to retrieve relevant data efficiently between worksheets.  
- Utilized **INDEX() MATCH()** for advanced and dynamic lookups between worksheets.  
- Created new & necessary calculated fields.  
- Implemented **multiple IF functions**, as well as **nested IF functions** to properly categorize data.  
- Standardized records with **date formatting** and **number formatting**.  
- Checked for and removed **duplicate records** to ensure data integrity.  
- Converted raw data ranges into structured **Excel tables** for easier and more dynamic manipulation.  

### Data Visualization  
- Designed **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts** to summarize and visualize data trends.  
- Increased user interaction with **timelines**.  
- Added **slicers** for quick dynamic filtering and exploration of data.  

### Dashboard Creation  
- Updated **Pivot Table data sources** to connect all designs in order to reflect new or modified data.  
- Integrated all elements into a cohesive **dashboard** for interactive reporting.   


## Questions
- Which year had the highest total sales?
- How much did each country contribute to the company's overall sales?
- Who purchased more - Loyalty members or non-loyalty members?
- What is the most popular coffee type overall?
- What was the highest-selling roast overall?
- Is there a preference in size for customers?


# Project Insight
- Total Sales were the best in 2021, with the US and Ireland having their highest-performing years.
- The US was responsible for ~79% of the total sales and buys the most products.
    - Ireland is second with a ~15% contribution, and last is the UK with ~6% contribution.    
- Non-loyalty members purchased more items and brought in more money overall than loyalty card members.
- Excelsa was the highest in sales; however, Arabica is the most popular amongst customers as it had the largest number of orders and quantities sold.
- Light was the most popular roast type as it had the highest sales and quantities ordered by customers.
- The size of 2.5 kg was the highest in sales, but 0.5 kg was most popular amongst customers displayed by their large amount of orders and quantities sold.


## Final Conclusion

- To improve overall sales, one or more of the following can occur:
    1) Increase the marketing for lower contributive countries, such as the UK and Ireland
    2) Pull away from the UK, tailor to the US, and promote in Ireland more
    3) Convert non-loyalty members
    4) Mimic any marketing strategies used in 2021 

The first strategy allows all means of product distribution to remain and focuses on growth within countries to improve the growth of the company itself. By allocating more resources to build up their lowest sectors, they can tap into untapped markets and increase brand awareness within those countries. This would balance out the distribution of revenue across the countries and encourage sustainable company growth across all existing markets.

An alternative to the previous strategy would be the second strategy, where the focus shifts to the strongest market, the US, while also targeting Ireland for secondary growth. By investing more in the US, the return is ensured because of the high demand. Cutting off the UK would not cause much harm because the UK struggles to reach at least $1,000 in sales each year, in fact, in 3 out of the 4 years, they failed to reach that mark. The US makes, in its worst year, 5 times as much. 

Another strategy would be to convert non-loyalty members into loyalty members. Assuming that loyalty members have to pay yearly/monthly subscriptions and that they receive some type of deal, more money is gained when loyalty members are acquired and maintained. Incentives ultimately encourage consumers to buy more, as sales and deals are heavy drivers of purchasing behaviors. By converting non-loyalty members into loyalty members, the company secures recurring revenue from subscription fees but also increases overall sales dues to consistent spending resulting from exclusive offers and discounts. 

Mimicking successful marketing strategies from 2021 can be used in tandem with any of these strategies, but it can also be used alone. Through analysis and contextual replication, the company can take past marketing campaigns that yielded high returns, and capitalize on strategies that resonated with their customers. The main changes in the attempted replication would come from current market conditions and social climates.

## Limitations
* Lack of information on perks of being a loyalty member
* Lack of information on how to become a loyalty member, whether there is a subscription or not
* Did not receive information for the full year of 2022
  * Causes the total sales from throughout the years to suddenly drop off, making it appear as an unsuccessful year 
* Unaware of any possible company changes or movements to display sudden growth in 2021
